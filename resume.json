    "summary": "I am a passionate Data Scientist with a strong focus on machine learning, data analysis, and cutting-edge research. My hands-on experience with building and fine-tuning machine learning models in Python, alongside my proficiency in SQL and visualization tools like Power BI and Tableau, has allowed me to turn complex datasets into impactful insights. Currently, I am honing my skills as a Data Analyst Intern at Pinnacle Healthcare Staffing, where I am eager to learn and contribute more, but my ultimate goal is to pursue a career as a Data Scientist.I thrive in environments that foster growth, and my time as a Graduate Teaching Assistant at Drexel University gave me the opportunity to deepen my knowledge, support students, and further my understanding of core data science principles. With a strong passion for research and continuous learning, I am always exploring new tools, techniques, and methodologies to stay at the forefront of the field. I am actively seeking opportunities that allow me to grow, contribute, and ultimately drive innovation in data science.",
